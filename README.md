The Idea is i made a web server which is load balancer server 


Created a Roundrobin method using circular single linkedlist ( Insert at last) 
Simple it will change the next server node pointer which will be running in loop


Also made if server is down or cannot connect to this load balancer then it will chnage then 
current server node pointer to another i.e (It will be handled by alive server)


Although i found it intresting to made and run and further improve as my knowledge about this topic increases
